# Introduction {#intro}

Security at the application layer provides an attractive option for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, for example where transport layer security is not sufficient {{I-D.hartke-core-e2e-security-reqs}} or where the protocol needs to work on a variety of underlying protocols. IoT devices may be constrained in various ways, including memory, storage, processing capacity, and energy {{RFC7228}}. A method for protecting individual messages at the application layer suitable for constrained devices, is provided by CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) {{RFC8152}}), which builds on the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) {{RFC7049}}.

In order for a communication session to provide forward secrecy, the communicating parties can run an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol with ephemeral keys, from which shared key material can be derived. This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), an authenticated ECDH protocol using CBOR and COSE objects. Authentication is based on credentials established out of band, e.g. from a trusted third party, such as an Authorization Server as specified by {{I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz}}. EDHOC supports authentication using pre-shared keys (PSK), raw public keys (RPK), and certificates (Cert).  Note that this document focuses on authentication and key establishment: for integration with authorization of resource access, refer to {{I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile}}. This document also specifies the derivation of shared key material.

The ECDH exchange and the key derivation follow {{SIGMA}}, NIST SP-800-56a {{SP-800-56a}}, and HKDF {{RFC5869}}. CBOR {{RFC7049}} and COSE {{RFC8152}} are used to implement these standards.

## Terminology {#terminology}

This document uses the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) {{I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}} to express CBOR data structures {{RFC7049}}. A vertical bar \| denotes byte string concatenation.

## Requirements Language {#terminology2}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Protocol Overview {#protocol}
SIGMA (SIGn-and-MAc) is a family of theoretical protocols with a large number of variants {{SIGMA}}. Like IKEv2 and TLS 1.3, EDHOC is built on a variant of the SIGMA protocol which provide identity protection, and like TLS 1.3, EDHOC implements the SIGMA-I variant as Sign-then-MAC. The SIGMA-I protocol using an AEAD algorithm is shown in {{fig-sigma}}.

{: #fig-sigma title="AEAD variant of the SIGMA-I protocol"}
{: artwork-align="center"}

The parties exchanging messages are called "U" and "V". They exchange identities and ephemeral public keys, compute the shared secret, and derive the keying material. The messages are signed, MACed, and encrypted.

* E_U and E_V are the ECDH ephemeral public keys of U and V, respectively.

* ID_U and ID_V are identifiers for the public keys of U and V, respectively.

* Sig(U; . ) and S(V; . ) denote signatures made with the private key of U and V, respectively.

* Enc(K; P; A) denotes AEAD encryption of plaintext P and additional authenticated data A using the key K derived from the shared secret. The AEAD MUST NOT be replaced by plain encryption, see {{sec-cons}}.

As described in Appendix B of {{SIGMA}}, in order to create a "full-fledged" protocol some additional protocol elements are needed. EDHOC adds:

* Explicit session identifiers S_U, S_V different from other concurrent session identifiers (EDHOC or other used protocol identifier) chosen by U and V, respectively. 

* Explicit nonces N_U, N_V chosen freshly and anew with each session by U and V, respectively.

* Computationally independent keys derived from the ECDH shared secret and used for encryption of different messages.

EDHOC also makes the following additions:

* Negotiation of key derivation, encryption, and signature algorithms:

   * U proposes one or more algorithms of the following kinds: 
       *  HKDF
       *  AEAD
       *  Signature verification 
       *  Signature generation 

   * V selects one algorithm of each kind

* Verification of common preferred ECDH curve:

   * U lists supported ECDH curves in order of preference
   
   * V verifies that the ECDH curve of the ephemeral key is the most preferred common curve

* Transport of opaque application defined data.

EDHOC is designed to encrypt and integrity protect as much information as possible, and all symmetric keys are derived using as much previous information as possible. EDHOC is furthermore designed to be as compact and lightweight as possible, in terms of message sizes, processing, and the ability to reuse already existing CBOR and COSE libraries. EDHOC does not put any requirement on the lower layers and can therefore be also be used e.g. in environments without IP.

This paper is organized as follows: {{general}} specifies general properties of EDHOC, including formatting of the ephemeral public keys and key derivation, {{asym}} specifies EDHOC with asymmetric key authentication, {{sym}} specifies EDHOC with symmetric key authentication, and {{examples}} provides a wealth of test vectors to ease implementation and ensure interoperability.

# EDHOC Overview {#general}

EDHOC consists of three messages (message_1, message_2, message_3) that maps directly to the three messages in SIGMA-I, plus an EDHOC error message. All EDHOC messages consists of a CBOR array where the first element is an int specifying the message type (MSG_TYPE). After creating EDHOC message_3, Party U can derive the traffic key (master secret) and protected application data can therefore be sent in parallel with EDHOC message_3. The application data may be protected using the negotiated AEAD algorithm and the explicit session identifiers S_U and S_V. EDHOC may be used with the media type application/edhoc defined in {{iana}}.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Party U                                                 Party V
   |                                                       |

   | ------------------ EDHOC message_3 -----------------> |
   |                                                       |
   | <----------- Protected Application Data ------------> |
   |                                                       |
~~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-flow title="EDHOC message flow"}
{: artwork-align="center"}

The EDHOC message exchange may be authenticated using pre-shared keys (PSK), raw public keys (RPK), or certificates (Cert). EDHOC assumes the existence of mechanisms (certification authority, manual distribution, etc.) for binding identities with authentication keys (public or pre-shared). EDHOC with symmetric key authentication is very similar to EDHOC with asymmetric key authentication, the difference being that information is only MACed, not signed.

EDHOC also allows opaque application data (UAD and PAD) to be sent. Unprotected Application Data (UAD_1, UAD_2) may be sent in message_1 and message_2, while Protected Application Data (PAD_3) may be send in message_3. 

## Formatting of the Ephemeral Public Keys {#cose_key}

The ECDH ephemeral public key SHALL be formatted as a COSE_Key of type EC2 or OKP according to section 13.1 and 13.2 of {{RFC8152}}. The curve X25519 is mandatory to implement. For Elliptic Curve Keys of type EC2, compact representation and compact output as per {{RFC6090}} SHALL be used, i.e. the 'y' parameter SHALL NOT be present in the The COSE_Key object. COSE {{RFC8152}} always use compact output for Elliptic Curve Keys of type EC2.

## Key Derivation {#key-der}

Key and IV derivation SHALL be done as specified in Section 11.1 of {{RFC8152}} with the following input:

* The PRF SHALL be the HKDF {{RFC5869}} in the ECDH-SS w/ HKDF negotiated during the message exchange (HKDF_V).

* The secret SHALL be the ECDH shared secret as defined in Section 12.4.1 of {{RFC8152}}.

* The salt SHALL be the PSK when EDHOC is authenticated with symmetric keys and the empty string "" when EDHOC is authenticated with asymmetric keys.

* The fields in the context information COSE_KDF_Context SHALL have the following values:

  + AlgorithmID is an int or tstr as defined below

  + PartyUInfo = PartyVInfo = ( nil, nil, nil )
  
  + keyDataLength is a uint as defined below
  
  + protected SHALL be a zero length bstr

  + other is a bstr and SHALL be aad_2, aad_3, or exchange_hash 

where exchange_hash, in non-CDDL notation, is:

exchange_hash = H( H( message_1 \| message_2 ) \| message_3 ) 

where H() is the hash function in HKDF_V.

For message_i the key, called K_i, SHALL be derived using other = aad_i, where i = 2 or 3. The key SHALL be derived using AlgorithmID set to the integer value of the negotiated AEAD (AEAD_V), and keyDataLength equal to the key length of AEAD_V. 

If the AEAD algorithm requires an IV, then IV_i for message_i SHALL be derived using other = aad_i, where i = 2 or 3. The IV SHALL be derived using AlgorithmID = "IV-GENERATION" as specified in section 12.1.2. of {{RFC8152}}, and keyDataLength equal to the IV length of AEAD_V.

Application specific traffic keys and other data SHALL be derived using other = exchange_hash. AlgorithmID SHALL be a tstr defined by the application and SHALL be different for different data being derived (an example is given in {{app-a2}}). keyDataLength is set to the length of the data being derived.

# EDHOC Authenticated with Asymmetric Keys {#asym}

## Overview {#asym-overview}

EDHOC supports authentication with raw public keys (RPK) and certificates with the requirements that:

* Party U SHALL be able to identify Party V's public key using ID_V.

* Party V SHALL be able to identify Party U's public key using ID_U.

Raw public keys are stored as COSE_Key objects and identified with a 'kid' value, see {{RFC8152}}. Certificates can be identified in different ways, ID_CRED_U and ID_CRED_V may contain the credential used for authentication (e.g. x5bag or x5chain) or identify the credential used for authentication (e.g. x5t, x5u), see {{I-D.schaad-cose-x509}}. The full credential (e.g. X.509 certificates or a COSE_Key) are included in CRED_V and CRED_U.

Party U and Party V MAY use different type of credentials, e.g. one uses RPK and the other uses certificates. Party U and Party V MAY use different signature algorithms.

EDHOC with asymmetric key authentication is illustrated in {{fig-asym}}.

### Party U Processing of Message 1 {#asym-msg1-procU}

Party U SHALL compose message_1 as follows:

* Determine which ECDH curve to use with Party V. If U previously received from Party V an error message to message_1 with diagnostic payload identifying an ECDH curve in ECDH-Curves_U, then U SHALL generate an ephemeral from that curve. Otherwise the first curve in ECDH-Curves_U MUST be used. The content of ECDH-Curves_U SHALL be fixed, and SHALL not be changed based on previous error messages. 

* Generate an ephemeral ECDH key pair as specified in Section 5 of {{SP-800-56a}} and format the ephemeral public key E_U as a COSE_key as specified in {{cose_key}}. Let X_U be the x-coordinate of the ephemeral public key.
   
* Choose a session identifier S_U which is not in use and store it for the length of the protocol. The session identifier SHOULD be different from other concurrent session identifiers used by Party U. The session identifier MAY be used with the protocol for which EDHOC establishes traffic keys/master secret, in which case S_U SHALL be different from the concurrently used session identifiers of that protocol.

* Format message_1 as specified in {{asym-msg1-form}}.

### Party V Processing of Message 1 {#asym-msg1-procV}

Party V SHALL process message_1 as follows:

* Verify that the ECDH curve indicated by ECDH-Curve_U is supported, and that no prior curve in ECDH-Curves_U is supported.

* Validate that there is a solution to the curve definition for the given x-coordinate X_U.

If any verification step fails, Party V MUST send an EDHOC error message back, formatted as defined in {{err-format}}, and the protocol MUST be discontinued. If V does not support the curve ECDH-Curve_U, but supports another ECDH curves in ECDH-Curves_U, then the error message MUST include the following diagnostic payload describing the first supported ECDH curve in ECDH-Curves_U:

~~~~~~~~~~~
ERR_MSG = "Curve not supported; Z"

  S_U : bstr,  
  N_U : bstr / nil,    
  E_U : serialized_COSE_Key,
  ECDH-Curves_U : alg_array,
  HKDFs_U : alg_array,
  AEADs_U : alg_array,
  KID : bstr,
  ? APP_1 : bstr
)

serialized_COSE_Key = bstr .cbor COSE_Key

alg_array = [ + alg : int / tstr ]
~~~~~~~~~~~

where:

* MSG_TYPE = 4
* S_U - variable length session identifier
* N_U - variable length random nonce
* E_U - the ephemeral public key of Party U
* ECDH-Curves_U - EC curves for ECDH which Party U supports, in the order of decreasing preference
* HKDFs_U - supported ECDH-SS w/ HKDF algorithms
* AEADs_U - supported AEAD algorithms
* KID - identifier of the pre-shared key
* APP_1 - bstr containing opaque application data

### Party U Processing of Message 1 {#sym-msg1-procU}

Party U SHALL compose message_1 as follows:

* Determine which ECDH curve to use with Party V. If U previously received from Party V an error message to message_1 with diagnostic payload identifying an ECDH curve in ECDH-Curves_U, then U SHALL retrieve an ephemeral from that curve. Otherwise the first curve in ECDH-Curves_U MUST be used.

* Retrieve an ephemeral ECDH key pair generated as specified in Section 5 of {{SP-800-56a}} and format the ephemeral public key E_U as a COSE_key as specified in {{cose_key}}.

* Generate the pseudo-random nonce N_U.

* Choose a session identifier S_U which is not in use and store it for the length of the protocol. The session identifier SHOULD be different from other relevant concurrent session identifiers used by Party U. The session identifier MAY be used with the protocol for which EDHOC establishes traffic keys/master secret, in which case S_U SHALL be different from the concurrently used session identifiers of that protocol.

* Format message_1 as specified in {{sym-msg1-form}}.

### Party V Processing of Message 1 {#sym-msg1-procV}

Party V SHALL process message_1 as follows:

* Verify (OPTIONAL) that N_U has not been received before.

* Verify that at least one of each kind of the proposed algorithms are supported.

* Verify that the ECDH curve used in E_U is supported, and that no prior curve in ECDH-Curves_U is supported.

* For elliptic curves, validate that E_U is a valid point by verifying that there is a solution to the curve definition for the given parameter 'x'.

If any verification step fails, Party V MUST send an EDHOC error message back, formatted as defined in {{err-format}}, and the protocol MUST be discontinued. If V does not support the ECDH curve used in E_U, but supports another ECDH curves in ECDH-Curves_U, then the error message SHOULD include a diagnostic payload describing the first supported ECDH curve in ECDH-Curves_U.

* Generate the pseudo-random nonce N_V.

* Choose a session identifier S_V which is not in use and store it for the length of the protocol. The session identifier SHOULD be different from other relevant concurrent session identifiers used by Party V.

# Error Handling {#error}

## Error Message Format {#err-format}

This section defines a message format for an EDHOC error message, used during the protocol. This is an error on EDHOC level and is independent of the lower layers used. An advantage of using such a construction is to avoid issues created by usage of cross protocol proxies (e.g. UDP to TCP).

error SHALL be a CBOR array as defined below

~~~~~~~~~~~ CDDL
error = [
  MSG_TYPE : int,
  ? ERR_MSG : tstr 
]
~~~~~~~~~~~

where:

* MSG_TYPE = 0
* ERR_MSG is an optional text string containing the diagnostic payload, defined in the same way as in Section 5.5.2 of {{RFC7252}}.

# Security Considerations {#sec-cons}

EDHOC builds on the SIGMA-I family of theoretical protocols that provides perfect forward secrecy and identity protection with a minimal number of messages. The encryption algorithm of the SIGMA-I protocol provides identity protection, but the security of the protocol requires the MAC to cover the identity of the signer. Hence the message authenticating functionality of the authenticated encryption in EDHOC is critical: authenticated encryption MUST NOT be replaced by plain encryption only, even if authentication is provided at another level or through a different mechanism.

EDHOC adds an explicit message type and expands the message authentication coverage to additional elements such as algorithms, application data, and previous messages. EDHOC uses the same Sign-then-MAC approach as TLS 1.3.

EDHOC does not include negotiation of parameters related to the ephemeral key, but it enables Party V to verify that the ECDH curve used in the protocol is the most preferred curve by U which is supported by both U and V.

Party U and V must make sure that unprotected data and metadata do not reveal any sensitive information. This also applies for encrypted data sent to an unauthenticated party. In particular, it applies to APP_1 and APP_2 in the asymmetric case, and APP_1 and KID in the symmetric case. The communicating parties may therefore anonymize KID.

Using the same KID or unprotected application data in several EDHOC sessions allows passive eavesdroppers to correlate the different sessions. Another consideration is that the list of supported algorithms may be used to identify the application.

Party U and V are allowed to select the session identifiers S_U and S_V, respectively, for the other party to use in the ongoing EDHOC protocol as well as in a subsequent traffic protection protocol (e.g. OSCORE {{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}). The choice of session identifier is not security critical but intended to simplify the retrieval of the right security context in combination with using short identifiers. If the wrong session identifier of the other party is used in a protocol message it will result in the receiving party not being able to retrieve a security context (which will terminate the protocol) or retrieving the wrong security context (which also terminates the protocol as the message cannot be verified).

Party U and V must make sure that unprotected data does not trigger any harmful actions. In particular, this applies to APP_1 in the asymmetric case, and APP_1 and KID in the symmetric case. Party V should be aware that replays of EDHOC message_1 cannot be detected unless previous nonces are stored.

The availability of a secure pseudorandom number generator and truly random seeds are essential for the security of EDHOC. If no true random number generator is available, a truly random seed must be provided from an external source. If ECDSA is supported, "deterministic ECDSA" as specified in RFC6979 is RECOMMENDED.

Nonces MUST NOT be reused, both parties MUST generate fresh random nonces. 

Ephemeral keys SHOULD NOT be reused, both parties SHOULD generate fresh random ephemeral key pairs. Party V MAY reuse the ephemeral key to limit the effect of certain DoS attacks. For example, to reduce processing costs in the case of repeated uncompleted protocol runs, party V MAY pre-compute its ephemeral key E_V and reuse it for a small number of concurrent EDHOC executions, for example until a number of EDHOC protocol instances has been successfully completed, which triggers party V to pre-compute a new ephemeral key E_V to use with subsequent protocol runs.

The referenced processing instructions in {{SP-800-56a}} must be complied with, including deleting the intermediate computed values along with any ephemeral ECDH secrets after the key derivation is completed.

Party U and V are responsible for verifying the integrity of certificates. The selection of trusted CAs should be done very carefully and certificate revocation should be supported.

The choice of key length used in the different algorithms needs to be harmonized, so that a sufficient security level is maintained for certificates, EDHOC, and the protection of application data. Party U and V should enforce a minimum security level. 

Note that, depending on the application, the keys established through the EDHOC protocol will need to be renewed, in which case the communicating parties need to run the protocol again.

Implementations should provide countermeasures to side-channel attacks such as timing attacks.

# PSK Chaining

An application using EDHOC with symmetric keys may have a security policy to change the PSK as a result of successfully completing the EDHOC protocol. In this case, the old PSK SHALL be replaced with a new PSK derived using other = exchange_hash, AlgorithmID = "EDHOC PSK Chaining" and keyDataLength equal to the key length of AEAD_V, see {{key-der}}.



# EDHOC with CoAP and OSCORE {#app-a}

## Transferring EDHOC in CoAP {#app-a1}

EDHOC can be transferred as an exchange of CoAP {{RFC7252}} messages, with the CoAP client as party U and the CoAP server as party V. By default EDHOC is sent to the Uri-Path: "/.well-known/edhoc", but an application may define its own path that can be discovered e.g. using resource directory {{I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory}}.

In practice, EDHOC message\_1 is sent in the payload of a POST request from the client to the server's resource for EDHOC. EDHOC message\_2 or the EDHOC error message is sent from the server to the client in the payload of a 2.04 Changed response. EDHOC message\_3 or the EDHOC error message is sent from the client to the server's resource in the payload of a POST request. If needed, an EDHOC error message is sent from the server to the client in the payload of a 2.04 Changed response

An example of successful EDHOC exchange using CoAP is shown in {{fig-edhoc-oscore-det}}.

## Deriving an OSCORE context from EDHOC {#app-a2}

When EDHOC is use to derive parameters for OSCORE {{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}, the parties must make sure that the EDHOC session identifiers are unique Recipient IDs in OSCORE.  In case that the CoAP client is party U and the CoAP server is party V:

* The AEAD Algorithm is AEAD_V, as defined in this document

* The Key Derivation Function (KDF) is HKDF_V, as defined in this document

* The Client's Sender ID is S_V, as defined in this document

* The Server's Sender ID is S_U, as defined in this document

* The Master Secret is derived as specified in {{key-der}} of this document, with other = exchange_hash, AlgorithmID = "EDHOC OSCORE Master Secret" and keyDataLength equal to the key length of AEAD_V.

* The Master Salt is derived as specified in {{key-der}} of this document, with other = exchange_hash, AlgorithmID = "EDHOC OSCORE Master Salt" and keyDataLength equal to 64 bits.
